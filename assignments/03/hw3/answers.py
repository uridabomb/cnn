part4_q1 = r"""

for 2 main reasons:
- characters that are far from each other are less semantically connected or relevant to each other. 
splitting to sequences prevents the loss from being effected by far, hence less relevant chars.
- splitting to shorter sequences sequences speeds up the training - each batch takes less time to calaulate and propogate changes to the model.


"""

part4_q2 = r"""
- the method for the model to "remember" more than sequence length is with the "hidden state" of the GRU.


"""

part4_q3 = r"""
unlike other learning tasks, here the order of samples is important. as we mentioned, past sequences influence the hidden state.
hence -  it's important to feed them in correct order and not shuffle so that the "hidden state" represents the context accuratly..

"""

part4_q4 = r"""
**Your answer:**
- while sampling, we want out text to look structured and prevent mistakes and "random feeling" in the text.
this is why we lower the temperature and "pushing" the more likely outputs to being even more likely.

- very high temperature makes the chracter distribution very "soft": all characters have similar probability, and text looks more random.

- very low temperature makes the probability distribution more "steep" -the largest logit is pushed close to 1, and the sampling becomes very conservative and non-diverse. similar sequences are likely to be generated many times.
